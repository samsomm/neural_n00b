    "### Neural Network Implementation with PyTorch\n",
    "- Implement a Neural Network using PyTorch. \n",
    "- Ensure the network is suitable for handling the 3D data structure of the dataset.\n",
    "- Tailor the architecture to effectively learn from the dataset for digit classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy Calculation\n",
    "- After training, evaluate the model on a test set.\n",
