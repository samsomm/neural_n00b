    "# Cat and Dog Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves building a binary classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using logistic regression. Below are the steps followed in this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Dataset\n",
    "- The project uses the [Cat and Dog dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog).\n",
    "- This dataset consists of images of cats and dogs, which are used to train and test the model for binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Prepare Dataset and Train Model\n",
    "- The dataset is first preprocessed to be suitable for input into the logistic regression model. This includes resizing images, converting them to grayscale or color, and flattening them into a 1D array (if necessary).\n",
    "- We use the Logistic Regression model from the scikit-learn library. More details can be found on the [LogisticRegression documentation page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html).\n",
    "- The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Model Evaluation\n",
    "- The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the modelâ€™s predictions on the test set with the actual labels.\n",
    "- Accuracy is determined using the formula: \\(\\frac{\\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\\text{Total Number of Predictions}}\\).\n",
    "- This metric gives us an understanding of how well our model performs in distinguishing between images of cats and dogs.\n",
